Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) is a managed database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of a relational database in the cloud. With Amazon RDS, you can choose from several popular database engines, including:
  Amazon Aurora (MySQL and PostgreSQL compatible)
MySQL
MariaDB
PostgreSQL
Oracle
Microsoft SQL Server
Key features of Amazon RDS include:

Automatic backups and snapshots: RDS automatically backs up your database and allows you to restore it to a specific point in time.
Scalability: You can easily scale your database's compute and storage resources with just a few clicks or API calls.
High availability: With Multi-AZ deployments, RDS can automatically replicate data across multiple availability zones to ensure high availability.
Security: RDS supports encryption at rest and in transit, as well as integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control.
Automated maintenance: RDS handles routine database tasks like software patching and backups.
